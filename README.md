## Digital Clock

### Introduction 
This is a clock is based on 74xx series TTL logic ICs. The clock pulse is generated by a 32.768kHz crystal which is further divided by divider ICs and a 1Hz pulse is obtained. This pulse is used to drive the seconds, minutes and hour counters. The display is a simple 7 segment LED display driven by 7447 BCD to 7 segment decoder.

The schematics and PCB has been designed in KiCad. This repository contains the complete KiCad project files made in version 6.0 of KiCad.
